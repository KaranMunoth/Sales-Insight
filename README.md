### **Problem Statement**  

This project focuses on analyzing sales insights for **AtliQ Hardware**, an India-based company specializing in computer hardware and peripherals. AtliQ Hardware supplies products to various retailers, including **Surge Stores** and **Nomad Stores**, across the country. The company's headquarters is in **Delhi**, with multiple regional offices throughout **India**.  

#### **Business Challenge**  

The **Sales Director** at AtliQ Hardware is facing significant challenges in a rapidly evolving market. With the market growing dynamically, tracking sales performance has become increasingly difficult. Moreover, the company has been experiencing a decline in overall sales, raising concerns about business growth.  

AtliQ Hardware has **Regional Managers** overseeing different areas:  
- **North India**  
- **South India**  
- **Central India**  

Whenever the Sales Director needs regional insights, he relies on phone conversations with these managers, who provide verbal updates on past sales and future growth projections. However, this approach lacks **data-backed proof**, making it difficult for the Sales Director to assess the business's true performance accurately. This lack of visibility into **key sales trends and regional performance** has led to frustration, as he is unable to pinpoint the reasons behind the declining sales.  

#### **Proposed Solution**  

To address this issue, the goal is to develop a **simple yet effective data visualization tool** that the Sales Director can access daily. By leveraging **Power BI**, this project aims to build a **sales dashboard** that provides real-time, data-driven insights, enabling better decision-making. With this tool, the company will be able to:  
- **Monitor sales performance with factual data** rather than relying on verbal reports.  
- **Identify trends and problem areas** affecting sales.  
- **Make data-driven decisions** to improve business growth and drive revenue.  

This project will help AtliQ Hardware transition from **manual, inconsistent reporting** to a **streamlined, analytics-based approach**, ultimately enhancing business performance.
